Test Scenarios:

1. Test when helper's "Dontknow" function operates correctly:
  - This is a function from an external package. Hence, the initial test scenario should cover the situation where this function has a successful operation, and whether the returned value is correctly assigned to variable 'a' and printed.

2. Test when helper's "Dontknow" function fails:
  - Another scenario should include a fail condition for the "Dontknow" function. In case the function doesn't work as expected, how would 'test()' handle that?

3. Test the parameter value for the "Dontknow" function:
  - Validate the outcome when passing different parameter values to the "Dontknow" function. For instance, check with negative numbers, zero, and well as larger numbers.

4. Test when helper package is missing or has an error:
  - It's crucial to ensure that the helper package is present and it has no errors. Check if the test function manages such a situation.

5. Test with 'Println' failure:
  - Even though is highly unlikey, it would be useful to test a scenario where 'Println' cannot print the value of 'a' for some reason.

6. Test the behavior with the function 'test' called concurrently:
  - If the function is used in a concurrent context, check if it behaves as expected.

7. Test for function's physical limit:
  - This scenario includes testing what would happen if the function is called repeatedly, to test for any memory leaks or performance degradation.

8. Test when input parameters for "Dontknow" function are unexpected or invalid:
  - Check how the 'test' function handles the situation when "Dontknow" function gets an unexpected or invalid input, like string or special characters instead of numbers.
