/*
Test Scenarios:

 1. Test functionality of helper.Dontknow function:
    -Assuming that the role of the helper.DontKnow() function is not clearly specified in the question. Their test scenarios would depend on its intended functionality.

2. Ensure the helper.Dontknow function is called with the correct parameters:
  - Check if the function behaves as expected when provided with 1 and 2 as arguments.

3. Ensure the helper.Dontknow function does not impact the functionality of the test function:
  - Even if there is some kind of error or unexpected behavior within helper.DontKnow(), the test() function should be able to handle these situations gracefully and not crash.

4. Validate helper.Dontknow functionâ€™s return type and returned results:
  - Assuming we are unaware of what type helper.DontKnow() is expected to return. Tests should check this return type and the values of it.

5. Check the function's response to different input types:
  - Execute the function with both the expected and different types of input to ensure it can handle a variety of data.

6. Evaluate if the helper.Dontknow function returns an error when provided with incorrect or unexpected parameters.
  - Play around with the arguments to see how it responds to invalid inputs.

7. Ensure the function's output is displayed properly:
  - Confirm the output is correctly printed to the console, ensuring the fmt.Println(a) line is working as expected.

8. Ensure the helper.Dontknow function works with edge cases:
  - If the helper function has some kind of range limitations, ensuring it is tested at the extremes of these ranges.

9. Test how the function handles nil or zero values.

(These test scenarios listed above are based on the assumption as the functionality of helper.Dontknow function is not explicitly provided in the question.)
