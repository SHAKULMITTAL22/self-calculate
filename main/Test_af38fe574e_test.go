/*
1. Test Scenario 1: Verify if the function `Dontknow` under the helper package is actually receiving two integer parameters correctly and returning the expected output.

2. Test Scenario 2: Double-check whether function `Dontknow` is properly implemented to handle 1 and 2 as input values. It needs to provide a consistent output in multiple runs.

3. Test Scenario 3: Examine what happens when the function `Dontknow` returns a value, this value is properly printed on the console by `test()` function.

4. Test Scenario 4: Analyze what happens when function `Dontknow` under the helper package fails or crashes. The `test` function should be able to handle the failure gracefully.

5. Test Scenario 5: Consider negative testing where function `test` is supposed to fail when `Dontknow` function is given wrong inputs or types other than integers.

6. Test Scenario 6: Check how the function `test` behaves when it gets an expected error from the `Dontknow` function. It should be capable of handling that error and maybe even return it to the caller.

7. Test Scenario 7: Monitor the performance of the `test` function when the `Dontknow` function takes long time to complete. It should not result in significant slowing down and should not cause other parts of the software to malfunction.

8. Test Scenario 8: Cross-check the overall complexity of `test`. If it's too high, reconsider rewriting or refactoring it to make the function easier to test and maintain.

9. Test Scenario 9: Verify if `test` is thread-safe when the `Dontknow` function is called concurrently in different threads.

10. Test Scenario 10: Validate whether imported external package `github.com/SHAKULMITTAL22/self-calculate/helper` is available and accessible.
