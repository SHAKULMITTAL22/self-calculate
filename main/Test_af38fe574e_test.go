/*
1. Test if the "Dontknow" function from the helper package returns the expected output for the given input (1, 2).

2. Test if the "Dontknow" function from the helper package is able to return an output at all. This would help in identifying if there are any implementation issues with the "Dontknow" function.

3. Test what happens when negative numbers are passed as parameters to the "Dontknow" function. To test how the function handles negative values.

4. Test what happens when zero is passed as a parameter to the "Dontknow" function. Specifically, this scenario is designed to test if the function has been properly defined to handle zero values.

5. Test what happens when extremely large numbers are passed as parameters to the "Dontknow" function to check if there is an overflow error.

6. Test what happens when decimals are passed as parameters to the "Dontknow" function.

7. Test if the "Dontknow" function can handle a situation where the numerical parameters have not been passed at all (missing parameter scenario).

8. Test what happens when non-numeric parameters are passed to the "Dontknow" function. For example, strings or boolean values.

9. Test if the implementation of the "test()" function is able to handle the instance when the "Dontknow" function takes more time to return the output.

10. Test if the printed output of the "test()" function matches with the value that is returned from the "Dontknow" function.

11. Test the "Dontknow" function with multiple sets of random numbers to ensure consistency in the output of the function.
